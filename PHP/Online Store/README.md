Online store wrtitten with PHP

**_No focus on the UI only functionality_**

On the first page, the products that can be purchased are displayed with product name, a short description, price and a "shopping cart". The products are stored in a database on the web server. You must create an account and log in to order an item, so if you try to add an item without being logged in, you will be sent to the login page.
There is an administration page where you can add, remove and change products. You can only do this if you are logged in as Admin. Passwords for users and admin are checked against the database and are stored in encrypted form. The page is protected against SQL injections.
